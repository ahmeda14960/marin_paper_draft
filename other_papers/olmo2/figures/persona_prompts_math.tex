Create a math problem related to the following persona:\\\\
\texttt{\{persona\}}\\\\
Note:\\\\
1. The math problem should be challenging and involve advanced mathematical skills and knowledge. Only top talents can solve it correctly.\\
2. You should make full use of the persona description to create the math problem to ensure that the math problem is unique and specific to the persona.\\
3. Your response should always start with "Math problem:". Your response should not include a solution to the created math problem.\\
4. Your created math problem should include no more than 2 sub-problems.
