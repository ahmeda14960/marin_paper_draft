  "body": "## Description\n\nWell, it happened. the 32b hit a spike it didn't recover from.\n\nI advertently turned off our update clipping. It was fine.... until it wasn't.\n\nWe hit what in absolute terms was a small spike, but somehow the model didn't bounce back. Sigh.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933ad99c-80a3-47d8-8de8-711f3cee0c8d)\n\nThe issue is that second spike. Loss went from ~1.96 to ~2.02, but it only recovered to ~1.975. It's cooked.\n\nMy somewhat chaotic plot of what happened:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30f3c82-e3e8-475c-b26d-dd36c5854379)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42888a8c-3c64-4495-9af8-2342fd8b2a9a)\n\nLuckily we have a checkpoint literally the step before the spike. So we can do some Science.\n\nWe're going to use the update history from a previous checkpoint which will clip the update norm.\n\n\n## Hypothesis or Goal\n\nThe clip will mitigate the spike and cause it to return to normal.\n\n### Links\n\n(Delete any that aren't applicable.)\n\n* WandB Report:  (link)\n* Data Browser: (link)\n* (etc.)\n\n\n## Results\n\n(What did you find, including relevant evaluation metrics, etc.)\n\n",
